# Customer-Purchase-Analytics-using-PySpark
This project demonstrates how to analyze customer purchase behavior using Apache PySpark.

We clean, transform, and aggregate customer transaction data to derive useful insights such as:

Total spend per customer

Most popular product categories

Monthly revenue trends

The focus is on using PySpark DataFrame API for large-scale data manipulation, making it suitable for big data environments.
